# Candy-Production-Analysis-in-USA

The "Candy Production Analysis in USA" project is a comprehensive exploration of candy production trends in the United States, with the goal of understanding and predicting production patterns over time. The dataset includes key features such as observation date, industrial production index (IPG3113N), and candy production.

The project follows a structured lifecycle that encompasses data acquisition, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modelling, and forecasting. 

**1. Data Acquisition:**
   The project initiates the collection of relevant data, encompassing historical records of candy production, observation dates, and the industrial production index.

**2. Data Preprocessing:**
   The acquired data undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, and outliers, and ensure data consistency. This phase involves data cleaning, normalization, and the creation of relevant time series structures.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   Utilizing statistical methods and visualizations powered by Seaborn and Matplotlib, the project conducts exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, correlations, and anomalies within the candy production dataset. This step provides valuable insights into the historical trends and relationships between variables.

**4. Time Series Forecasting:**
   The project employs the Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors (SARIMAX) algorithm for time series forecasting. This sophisticated model considers seasonality, trends, and external factors, making it well-suited for predicting candy production in the USA.

**5. Model Evaluation:**
   The forecasting model is rigorously evaluated using appropriate metrics to ensure its accuracy and reliability. This step involves assessing the model's performance on validation data and making necessary adjustments.

**6. Prediction and Insights:**
   With a validated model in place, the project generates predictions for future candy production in the USA. The insights derived from the forecast provide valuable information for stakeholders in the candy industry, helping them make informed decisions regarding production planning, resource allocation, and market strategies.

By following this comprehensive project lifecycle, the "Candy Production Analysis in USA" project aims to contribute meaningful insights to the candy industry and serve as a practical example of utilizing machine learning for forecasting and decision support in production-oriented domains.
